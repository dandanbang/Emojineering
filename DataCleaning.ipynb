    "Data cleaning steps:\n",
    "- replace @ handles with: hdl (chose a word with no punctuation so no extra step is needed to process, hdl = handle)\n",
    "- replace urls by: url\n",
    "- replace emoticons with corresponding emojis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of these, first check what is the prevalence and if it is worth the effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas:\n",
    "- split hashtags into words\n",
    "    - Some people seperate words in hashtags with capitals. Make it much easier to seperate. \n",
    "- replace contractions\n",
    "- spellchecking\n",
    "- what does quoted messages mean? Someone quoting somebody else? Should we consider this text or remove it? \n",
    "- there are some smileys that are still in punctuation and not in unicode, eg :-P, :-)\n",
    "- Tweets not in english\n",
    "- Character ngram will probably be more efficient due to the really low quality of speach\n",
    "- Retweets have two formats:\n",
    "    - Either finish with RT &lt;content of retweet>\n",
    "    - OR \"&lt;content of retweet>\" &lt;content of tweet>\n",
    "    - Can also have mutliple embedings with “ for second level. E.g. : \n",
    "\"@letwerkaaaaa: “@Palmira_0: HAHA WHEN I WAS LITTLE I WAS FAT AS FUCK:joy:” Same I was so fat that they thought my vagina was a dick\" LMFAO\n",
    "    - For now will leave them here. We might have to consider while training if it is retweeted content or original content. Actually impacts the single response rate, ie when people just add an emoji to a tweet (as in the emoji is the sole content) "
